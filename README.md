# Discord-custom-background
This Chrome Extension enables you to choose a custom Discord background, instead of the default white or dark mode background.

To install for yourself:

1. Click the green "clone or download" button above on this page.
2. Click "download zip" from the dropdown.
3. Once the zip is downloaded, open it to unpack/unzip it.
4. To set your own custom background, open the "style.css" file and replace the URL on line 4 (I don't have an options page yet, but will add soon so this process is easier).
5. Save your changes.
6. Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) and click "Load Unpacked".
7. Select the unpacked folder from step 3.
8. The Extension should appear in the list of your Chrome extensions if things worked.
9. Reload or open Discord to see the new background!

Let me know if you have trouble on Discord, @Jett#2782.
